# Release notes
v.4.0
#### Features:
* Ledgers now uses Keycloak as Identity Provider (IDP)
* Reset password functionality on online-banking UI and TPP UI.

Starting from version 4.0, Ledgers moves to Keycloak IDP. To avoid data loss, all users from your Ledgers database will automatically migrate to Keycloak DB during Ledgers startup. The passwords for all your past users in Keycloak DB will be set to `12345`. So, keep in mind that you MUST change all password for your users to avoid security vulnerabilities. This functionality is provided on TPP UI and online-banking UI (`Reset password`). 

New configuration fields were added to ledgers-app 'application.yml':

- `keycloak.auth-server-url`: the URL to perform authentication in Keycloak (e.g. http://localhost:8080/auth)
- `keycloak.realm`: the name of realm. It will be created automatically during Ledgers startup.
- `keycloak.resource`: the name of the client, created automatically also.
- `keycloak.public-client`: if the client is public or confidential.
- `keycloak.credentials.secret`: client secret for your client.

- `keycloak-sync.admin.username`: Keycloak admin console username.
- `keycloak-sync.admin.password`: Keycloak admin console password.
